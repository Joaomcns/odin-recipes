      <h2>Description:</h2> 
        <p>If there’s one thing Portuguese cuisine does well,it’s comfort food. 
          Perhaps the best example is Bacalhau com Natas,or Salt Cod with Cream.<br>
          It’s a delicious combination of flaky bacalhau served in a mixture of cream, potatoes, and onion, then topped with cheese and baked in the oven. <br>
          On a chilly evening it doesn’t get much better than taking a scoop of creamy Bacalhau com Natas from a freshly baked oven dish. 
          Its origins aren’t known, but it’s one of the most popular ways of serving bacalhau you’ll find in Portugal.

      <h2>Steps:</h2> 
        <ol>
          <li>Rinse and drain the soaked cod, place it in a medium pot, and cover it with hot water. Place it over a medium heat, bring it to a boil, and let it simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Drain the fish, saving 1 cup of the water.</li>
          <li>In another medium-size pot, combine the butter, flour, and a drizzle of olive oil. Place It over low to medium heat. After the butter has melted, cook the mixture for around 2 minutes, constantly stirring.</li>
          <li>Add the milk and fish water, continue stirring until thickened. We want a bechamel consistency.</li>
          <li>Stir in the natas (fresh cream), season it with nutmeg, salt and black pepper.</li>
          <li>Place a frying pan over medium heat, add a tbsp of olive oil, the onions and garlic. Fry them till the onions are translucent. Add the fish and fry for another 5 minutes. Transfer it to a mixing bowl.</li>
          <li>Cover the bottom of the same frying pan with olive oil. Fry the potatoes in batches, till golden brown. Rest it on some absorbent towels to drain any excessive oil.</li>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 200 Celsius.</li>
          <li>Combine the fish sauce, the potatoes, and the fish. Place it on a baking dish, sprinkle the cheese on top,</li>
          <li>Place it in the oven and roast it for 20 minutes or until the cheese is golden brown.</li>
          <li>Serve sprinkled with some fresh parsley.</li>
        </ol>
